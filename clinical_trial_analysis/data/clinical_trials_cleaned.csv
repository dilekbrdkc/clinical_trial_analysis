NCT07075510,Subcutaneous Daratumumab Administration in the Thigh Vs Abdomen in Plasma Cell Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07075510,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The purpose of this study is to look at the safety, tolerability, and serum concentration of daratumumab administered subcutaneously in the thigh versus the abdomen in patients with plasma cell disorders. Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody that can attach itself to the CD38 protein on the surface of abnormal plasma cells. Daratumumab can kill the abnormal plasma cells and/or help your immune system find and destroy them. Due to the way daratumumab works, normal cells may also be affected. All reference to the words ""study drug"" in this consent form will mean Daratumumab.

Daratumumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alone or in combination with other standard of care drugs for treatment of multiple myeloma in both subcutaneous (DARZALEX FASPRO®) and intravenous (DARZALEX®) ways of being delivered. The FDA has also approved the subcutaneous administration of daratumumab combined with other standard of care drugs for patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Subcutaneous means the drug is given by an injection just beneath the skin. Intravenous (IV) means the drug is given as an injection directly into a vein.

Usually when given subcutaneously, the study drug is given by an injection in the abdomen. Having the drug given by subcutaneous injection (underneath the skin of the abdomen) has lessened the IV related side effects and the drug administration by injection is quicker.

However, some patients cannot receive the study drug injections in their abdomen because they find them very painful or have other medical reasons making it difficult to get these injections. The goal of this study is to see if getting the study drug subcutaneously, injected under the skin by a needle, in the patient's upper thigh will have the same results, or better results, as getting the injection in the abdomen. This would therefore, improve patients access to the drug and provide an alternative place to receive the injection of the drug.

This study will take place at University of Maryland Medical Center and there will be about 30 people who will take place in this study here. Dr. Badros is the Sponsor-Investigator of the study. Funding to conduct the study and study drug are being provided by Johnson \& Johnson Innovative Medicine (J\&J IM).",NO,Plasma Cell Disorder,DRUG: Daratumumab Injection,"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], To characterize the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous daratumumab administered in the thigh vs the abdomen in patients with plasma cell disorders.

Astigmatism is the most common refractive disorder in adults, hence there is a high prevalence of preexisting astigmatism in cataract patients. Access to astigmatism correction during cataract surgery allows for improved visual outcomes for patients. Toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) are the procedure of choice to correct corneal astigmatism of one diopter or more in cases undergoing cataract surgery. Rotational stability is a key factor for successful outcomes with toric IOLs. Postoperative toric IOL misalignment is the major factor responsible for suboptimal visual outcomes after toric IOL implantation.

In intensive, mostly still young, male athletes, this problem seems to be related to a bony deformity on the head of this thighbone, a so-called CAM. FAI itself gives rise to pain symptoms, but in time can even lead to premature osteoarthritis. However, the cause of a CAM deformity itself, nor how FAI then arises, is insufficiently known. In view of FAI prevention and its better treatment, this project thus tries to better understand the underlying mechanisms. For this purpose, we will combine detailed biomechanical evaluations of specific movement patterns with advanced medical imaging and state of the art clinical evaluations to longitudinally follow up a group with a known high risk of developing a CAM deformity, being young male elite soccer players. Findings within this study will be additionally compared with similar analyses performed in patients with FAI.

However the reported incidence of postoperative infection or surgical site infection after total knee replacement has been around 1 to 2 percent. The cost and expenditure for treating periprosthetic infection are high and the results are often detrimental to the patients who suffered from the complication. To decrease the wound healing complication related to the contamination of bacteria, an antibacterial suture was used successfully in some clinical settings and in animal experiments. Whether the antibacterial suture material could be used in patients with total knee replacement has not been addressed in the past. The investigators therefore propose a prospective randomized double-blinded study to investigate the efficacy of an antibacterial suture material in total knee replacement. The inclusion criteria are patients with degenerative osteoarthritis without previous surgery to the index knee. Patients who have inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, who have neurovascular disease of the lower extremities, who have history of liver cirrhosis or under hemodialysis for renal failure are excluded.

NCT02124655,Antiplaque Effect of Essential Oils and 0.2% Chlorhexidine on an in Situ Model of Oral Biofilm Growth.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02124655,,COMPLETED,"The accumulation and maturation of oral biofilm in the gingival margin is widely recognised to be the primary aetiological factor in the development of chronic gingivitis. Based on this association, the current treatment of gingivitis is focused on biofilm disruption, which will normally include mechanical processes, both professionally and at home. However, for patients, it is not easy to achieve a proper level of plaque control. The efficient plaque control techniques are very time consuming and require a special motivation and skills for their optimum use. It was at this point where mouthwashes become important, due to the fact that they include diverse types of antimicrobial agents to complement the results of mechanical oral hygiene measures.

Chlorhexidine is considered the ""gold standard"" of oral antiseptics; nevertheless it has not been recommended for long periods of time due to its well-known secondary effects. All of these inconveniences have limited its acceptability among dental professionals and users; in contrast, however, are the exceptional antiseptic properties, promoting the interest of researchers in other alternative antiplaque agents. Mouthwashes containing essential oils in their formulation have received a lot of attention. Their antiplaque activity has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies, in which they were used in conjunction with mechanical oral hygiene measures.

In order to achieve a better understanding of the clinical effects that antimicrobial agents produce in the interior of the biofilm, it is necessary to apply a methodology in which the biofilm grows directly in the interior of the oral cavity but its three dimensional structure is not distorted by manipulation.

Data from the only randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the topic does not support this observation.

The investigators set out to investigate the feasibility of a double blind RCT comparing post-operative recovery following LH with that following LSH.

The investigators set out to recruit 50 participants from a single gynaecological surgeon's caseload. Web based randomisation was carried out at the time of study laparoscopy. Surgery was performed using a standardised technique.

Participants and the data handler were blinded to treatment allocation (double blind study where neither the patient nor the surgeon have knowledge of treatment group allocation at the time of questionnaire analysis).

Primary outcome is feasibility of recruitment to the study. The null hypothesis for this study is that 'a double blind, randomised controlled comparison of recovery following laparoscopic hysterectomy with recovery following laparoscopic sub-total hysterectomy' is not feasible.

Secondary outcomes included validated post-operative recovery and mood questionnaires at baseline, prior to discharge and at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. Validated questionnaires regarding pelvic floor function and sexual function will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months.

The majority of patients with mood disorders receive treatment in the primary care setting, within which approximately 10-30% of all patients present with a depressive disorder. Comprehensive 'Collaborative Care' models of depression management significantly improve depression outcomes and health-related quality of life. Core features of these programs include use of a trained depression care manager to closely coordinate with primary care clinicians, support treatment recommendations, provide patient education, conduct patient follow-up to ensure adequate treatment, and manage as-needed access to psychiatrists for patients with more complex presentations. Evidence based Collaborative Care models do not currently weave in the use of web-based or mobile technologies. These technologies offer unique features that may make collaborative depression care more effective. The digital health coaching program for depressive symptoms enhanced during Phase I of the current project is a web-based tool featuring video, text, links and graphics which provide patients with education, self-management techniques, tailored feedback, and tools for tracking treatment progress. The RESPECT-D (Re-engineering Systems of Primary Care Treatment of Depression) intervention is a collaborative depression management model for primary care. The primary objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of an enhanced Collaborative Care model for depression (RESPECT-D-E) to the standard model (RESPECT-D) for patients with minor and major depression and dysthymic disorder. This study will be a randomized controlled trial with 150 participants who are receiving antidepressant medication treatment in the primary care setting. The primary objectives are: reduction in subject reported depressive symptoms, improvement in subject reported health related quality of life and improvement in subject adherence to treatment regimen as demonstrated by self-report measures and clinician-administered assessment.

NCT01195493,Clinical and Microbiological Effects of an Essential Oils Solution Used as an Adjunct to Daily Oral Hygiene Practices in Chronic Periodontitis Patients in Supportive Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01195493,Listerine,COMPLETED,"Chronic periodontitis is a common infectious disease characterized by progressive attachment loss and alveolar bone resorption eventually resulting in tooth loss. The ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is to prevent this endpoint. At least when a strict supportive care program is implemented following active therapy, subsequent tooth loss is limited to a mean of about 0.1 per patient per year. In contrast, three to six times as many teeth may be lost if the disease is left untreated.

The objective of supportive care is to prevent disease recurrence, which is accomplished by strict home care and professional plaque control at regular intervals depending on the patient's needs. Evidently, not all patients are optimally compliant in terms of plaque control. Therefore, chemical aids could be administered to supplement mechanical plaque removal.

Essential oils solutions containing menthol, thymol, methyl salicylate and eucalyptol as active agents may be more appropriate to supplement daily home care. Clinical studies have shown an additional anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effect over mechanical plaque control without relevant side effects in healthy subjects and gingivitis patients.

Recently, significant reductions of periodontopathogens in the subgingival biofilm have been shown in periodontitis patients following subgingival irrigation using an essential oils solution. In addition, mouthrinsing on a daily basis seemed to substantially alter the subgingival microflora towards a less pathogenic one in gingivitis and periodontitis patients. Even though these are interesting findings, they should be considered exploratory since they relate to a small number of patients observed for only two weeks.

Among the recent advances in laparoscopy an important role was assumed by the methods of tissue extraction. In particular electronic power morcellators have become instruments of large use in surgical practice.

The tissue morcellator is an endoscopic instrument indicated for cutting, coring and extracting tissue in operative laparoscopy, and it has a pivotal role during specific gynaecologic procedures as well as myomectomy and hysterectomy. The main advantages offered by electronic morcellator consist in reduction of operative time and of risk in hernia formation, this last due to the absence of fascia's tearing or stretching.

Recently, a new generation of tissue morcellator has been commercialized. In particular, GYNECARE MORCELLEX (Ethicon-Johnson \& Johnson Gateway, US) and ROTOCUT G1 (Karl Storz, Culver City, CA, US) are two tissue morcellators currently available. These instruments seem to offer advantages over the previous models in terms of precision, speed and durability. The most useful of this features seems to be the higher speed, in particular it has been calculated that they morcellate tissues approximately four times faster than those of the previous generation. The high speed that characterizes this new morcellator potentially results in reduced operative time with consequent benefits in other surgical outcomes such as postoperative pain and recovery time.

Secondary end points are the TEWL on the other measuring points, pH-value and SCH. Additionally, secondary end points are the D-Squame method and the cytokine measurement with Sebutapes.

Hypotheses:

The intention of the study is to evaluate, whether the using of wet wipe on the diaper area has an influence on the TEWL of the newborns. The following hypotheses are present below:

H0 (Null hypothesis): The TEWL is indistinguishable between infants who get cleaned with wet wipe on the diaper area and infants who get cleaned with a cotton wool cloth, moistened with clear water on the diaper area, i.e.

TEWL clear water is equal TEWL wet wipe against H1 (Alternative hypothesis - bilateral): The TEWL is distinguishable between infants who get cleaned with wet wipe on the diaper area and infants who get cleaned with a cotton wool cloth, moistened with clear water on the diaper area, i.e.

NCT06602661,Reinforced and Non-Reinforced Staple Lines in Fissureless Lobectomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06602661,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Prolonged Air Leak (PAL) is a common and serious problem after lung surgery. It can lead to worse patient outcomes, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Reinforced staplers are designed to make the staple line stronger and reduce the risk of PAL. However, investigators don't know if they are better than standard staplers, especially in a specific type of lung surgery called fissureless lobectomy for lung cancer. This study aims to find out if reinforced staplers are more effective at reducing PAL and its complications compared to non-reinforced staplers.

Reinforced staplers have been used in lung surgeries and have shown to reduce PAL. For example, staplers with special materials like polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets have shown lower air leakage and fewer days with chest tubes. Other materials like expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) sleeves have also been used to manage air leaks in different types of lung surgeries. However, their effectiveness in fissureless lobectomy has not been studied yet.",NO,"Lung|Lung Adenocarcinoma|Lung Adenosquamous Carcinoma|Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell|Lung Carcinoma|Lobectomy|Lobectomy Patient|Lobectomy by Video-thoracoscopies|VATS",PROCEDURE: Fissureless Lobectomy with Reinforced Staple Lines|PROCEDURE: Fissureless Lobectomy with Non-Reinforced Staple Lines,"Change in Hospital Length of Stay Due to Prolonged Air Leak (PAL), 1.

Pre-existing astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery can be corrected by either corneal relaxing incisions or implantation of toric IOLs. While the safety and efficacy of these procedures are well established, there are various challenges associated with these techniques that surgeons need to overcome to achieve good outcomes postoperatively.

The use of iris registration technology that automatically compensates for cyclotorsion has the potential to improve the alignment accuracy of CRI or toric IOLs. The Cassini Ambient and Catalys Femtosecond Laser incorporate this technology to help cataract surgeons accurately align toric IOLs on the intended axis of implantation or accurately place CRI on the intended meridian.

NCT00214487,Bifocal Soft Contact Lenses and Their Effect on Myopia Progression in Children and Adolescents.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00214487,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether bifocal soft contact lenses are effective in controlling the progression of myopia in children and adolescents that exhibit a tendency to excessively cross their eyes while reading (esophoria or eso fixation disparity). Several studies have demonstrated that bifocal or progressive multifocal spectacles are effective in slowing the progression of myopia in children either with near point esophoria and/or with inadequate focusing at near. A prominent theory for one cause of myopia progression is that poorly focused images on the back of the eye (retina) cause the eye to lengthen, causing an increase in myopia.

NCT05240820,A Comparative Study of Scar Quality and Safety According to Suture Materials Following Excision of Benign Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05240820,,UNKNOWN,"Due to the rise in the incidence of giant benign tumors such as lipoma, excision of benign tumors on body have been performed by plastic surgeons. After excision of giant benign tumors, efforts should be include with a goal of achieving optimal cosmetic outcomes after subcutaneous and dermal sutures may be important to improve scar quality because suture methods might influence the final aesthetic outcome. Various absorbable suture materials have been used for tension-relieving deep sutures. Subcutaneous and dermal sutures using Polygalctin 910 (Vicryl®, Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson Ltd.), which is absorbable, synthetic, braided suture composed of a copolymer made from 90% glycolide and 10% L-lactide or polydioxanone (PDS®, Ethicon), which is composed of polyester and p-dioxanone with skin suture using polypropylene (Prolene®, Ethicon) have been commonly used after excision of tumors.

Although these sutures are particularly useful where combination of absorbable suture and extended wound support for up to six weeks is desirable, strong and secure skin sutures may be needed to improve scar quality following excision of tumors on back and abdomen due to their thick skins. However, increased wound closure times are their drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks, a new subcutaneous suture material composed of polydioxanone, StratafixTM Spiral PDS II® and a new skin suture material using combination of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and polyester mesh (Dermabond Prineo®, Ethicon) have been developed and skin sutures using combination of these two materials may be an alternative suture method to decrease wound closure times and improve scar quality for better wound closure with high-tension closure, favorable and encouraging results compared to traditional suture methods.

Although polyglactin 910, polydioxanone, polypropylene, and combination of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and polyester mesh have been used in general surgery and neurosurgery, no studies on the clinical outcomes, specifically on scar quality after excision of tumors have been reported in plastic surgery. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes associated with scar quality between the use of polyglactin 910 and polypropylene suture, and polydioxanone and combination of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and polyester mesh for multi-layer wound closure following excision of giant benign tumors.",NO,Scar Quality Assessment and Safety,PROCEDURE: multi-layer wound closure,"the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), aesthetic outcome as assessed by the overall impression, six months","the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), aesthetic outcome as assessed by the overall impression, three months","Postoperative complications, suture material exposure, hemorrhage, surgical site infection, wound infection, skin necrosis, wound dehiscence, seroma rates, and hyper- or hypoesthesia, six months",Korea University Guro Hospital,Johnson and Johnson Medical Korea Ltd,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,30.0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",WC-2020-09,2022-02-05,2023-02-28,2023-08-31,2022-02-15,,2022-02-15,,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN

NCT01943591,DELTA Trial: Does Embolization With Larger Coils Lead to Better Treatment of Aneurysms Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01943591,DELTA,COMPLETED,"Endovascular treatment with platinum coils is safe and effective in preventing rebleeding of intracranial aneurysms. Unfortunately, endovascular treatment of aneurysms with coils has been associated with incomplete occlusion at initial treatment (remnant) or at follow-up (recurrence). This in some studies has been as high as 20%. While many such aneurysm remnants or recurrences exhibit benign behavior, many require retreatment to prevent future hemorrhage.

A recent randomized controlled trial of aneurysm coiling revealed that aneurysms between 2 and 9.9 mm diameter were more likely to have an improved angiographic and composite clinical outcome when treated with hydrogel-coated coils, an improvement inferred to result from higher packing density afforded by hydrogel expansion(1). The use of hydrogel coils is associated with technical difficulties related to expansion and limited time for deployment. The investigators theorize that similar results could be achieved by using more voluminous bare platinum coils, leading to improved packing density compared to smaller caliber coils, and thus result in lower incidence of remnants or residuals. The relationship between packing densities and composite clinical endpoints having never been shown in a robust fashion, the investigators therefore propose a randomized clinical trial opposing coiling with soft 15-caliber coils to 10-caliber bare platinum coils in aneurysms varying in size from 3 to 9.9 mm.

To test the hypothesis that 15-caliber coiling systems are superior to standard 10-caliber coils in achieving better composite outcomes, the investigators propose the DELTA trial: Does Embolization with Larger coils lead to better Treatment of Aneurysms trial, a randomized controlled blinded trial with 2 subgroups of 282 patients each, 564 total:

NCT01821508,Clinical Study on Metabolic Surgery Compared to the Best Clinical Treatment in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01821508,MOMS,COMPLETED,"This is a prospective, open, randomized study involving 100 patients with microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, who will undergo gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ARM A) or receive best medical treatment (ARM B, control arm).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the control of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2.

The medical community is confronted with many different studies using various methodologies to investigate the best pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The treatment algorithm offers several different options according to the stage of the disease (which is different in each study). In addition, new drugs are being developed over the years, but are not always a guarantee of effective type 2 diabetes mellitus control \[MENDES, 2010\]. Furthermore, these drugs do not prevent the development of this disease, consequently increasing the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications.

Conversely, there is considerable evidence that surgery can be an adequate tool to promote type 2 diabetes mellitus remission in patients who are unresponsive to clinical treatment. Gastric bypass surgery is one of the most popular bariatric surgeries in the world, but its effects on microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established. Specialists suggest that the rapid and uncontrollable decrease in blood glucose adds to the concern that the surgery may paradoxically cause exacerbation of microvascular complications \[LEOW, 2005\], whereas gradual improvement in blood glucose before gastric bypass surgery may prevent this paradoxical worsening, leading to an interruption of this process, or even retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy remission.

However, there are no studies comparing the results of these two types of treatment (clinical vs. surgical) in a similar population and assessing the development of microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, in order to clarify such doubts, it is necessary and extremely desirable to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing gastric bypass with the best and most modern clinical treatment. Its findings could have a direct impact on hundreds of millions of diabetics by allowing the inclusion of surgical treatment as a safe and feasible therapeutic option for a significant portion of these patients.",NO,Complications of Diabetes Mellitus,OTHER: Clinical Treatment|PROCEDURE: Roux-En-Y gastric bypass surgery,"The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients that present normalization of the albumin/creatinine ratio in isolated urine samples (normal value considered as an albumin/creatinine ratio of less than 30 μg/mg )., Number of participants achieving remission Titrating the relation of urinary albumin/creatinine, 12, 24 and 60 months","Changes in diabetic retinopathy, Number of patients achieving resolution or reduction in the degree of retinopathy and/or macular oedema (severity scale), 12, 24 and 60 months|Changes in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, Number of patients with new or worsening of neuropathy, 12, 24 and 60 months|Use of pharmacological therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus, Number of medications necessary for targeting euglycaemia, 12, 24 and 60 months|Glycemic control, Number of patients achieving fasting glucose level \< 100 and HbA1c \< 6.5%, 12, 24 and 60 months|Blood pressure control, Number of patients achieving systolic blood pressure \<130 mm Hg and diastolic \<80 mm Hg, 12, 24 and 60 months|Lipids control, Number of patients with LDL\<100 or \<70 mg/dL in patients with previous cardiovascular events; HDL\>50 mg/dL and triglycerides \<150 mg/dL, 12, 24 and 60 months|Quality of life (SF-36), SF-36 questionnaire, 12, 24 and 60 months|Changes in hepatic fibrosis, Reduction of hepatic elastographic resistance, 12, 24 and 60 months",,Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz,"Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,100.0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,MOMS,2013-04-18,2021-04-29,2021-04-29,2013-04-01,,2021-05-28,,São Paulo,BRAZIL

In patients with suboptimal response to furosemide, alternative loop diuretics like torsemide or bumetanide may improve natriuresis.

The score for these parameters is summed and then multiplied by a constant that reflects the relative body area of that body region (head/neck = 0.10; trunk = 0.30; upper extremities = 0.20, lower extremities = 0.40). The total EASI score is calculated as a sum of the scores for the 4 individual body regions.

The other group will not get a patch, but will need to follow the other instructions anyway.

When a subject's outbreak begins, they will need to return to the study center within 24 hours. Then they will return according to the appointments given within 10 days. If the study staff sees that their sore has healed enough before 10 days, subjects will be told that they don't need to return again.

As long as subjects are in the study, they will need to answer a few simple questions every day on a card or booklet called a diary, starting the first day of their outbreak. If a subject is assigned to the patch group, they must wear the patch all the time, taking it off only to replace it (if it gets loose, dirty, or unsightly) and at the study center, when they are asked to remove the patch so the sore can be checked.

NCT01815411,Effect of Andosan in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01815411,Andosan-RA,COMPLETED,"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory disease that leads to significant pain, joint destruction and functional decline, and has a substantial economic impact both for sufferers and society. Although the etiology of RA is unknown, it is generally accepted that it arises from an interplay of genetic predisposition (in particular, HLA-DR allele subtypes and specific gene polymorphisms), immunological deregulation (e. g. autoantibody production), and environmental factors. The prevalence and incidence of RA in Norway is estimated to 0,4-0,5 % and 0,020-0,025 %, respectively, and incidence rates are 2-4-fold higher in women. Synovitis and bone resorption are key pathogenetic factors in RA and these patients have elevated cytokine levels in joints and blood (i.e. TNF, IL-1, IL-6). RA is also associated with significant comorbidity; the most important is premature cardiovascular disease that significantly contributes to increased mortality. Compared with the general population, mortality in RA is from 1,57-2,0-fold higher in Norway and Sweden, and their mean life expectancy is reduced by an average of 5-10 years. Medical treatment of RA consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic glucocorticosteroids, traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (including methotrexate) and biologic therapies (including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, anti-IL 6 and anti-CD20 therapy). Also, a considerable portion of the patients are in need of joint replacement surgery and in need of rehabilitation.

However, the treatment opportunities are still not optimal. In a large proportion of the patients, full control of the disease is not possible due to limited effect of available therapies and/or intolerance to these therapies. Therefore, there is a huge need to find new therapeutic alternatives to treat RA.

Since studies on healthy volunteers and IBD-patients support that the mushroom extract AndoSanTM exert an anti-inflammatory effect in vivo, the investigators wanted to examine in a pilot study whether this effect also was evident in patients with RA. A potential anti-inflammatory effect could prove beneficial in these seriously ill patients, who accordingly could experience less side effects (edema, granulocytopenia, diminished tissue repair) due to potential reduction number and dose of disease modifying drugs.",NO,Rheumatoid Arthritis,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Mushroom extract,"Symptom score, The symptom score will be registered at day 1 prior to the patients are given Andosan for 21 days, and at day 21 after the patients have consumed Andosan daily for 21 days., The duration of the experiment is 3 weeks (21 days)","Cytokine levels in harvested blood from the patients, Cytokine levels will be measured at day 1 prior to ingestion of Andosan and at day 21 after 21 days of Andosan consumption., The duration of the experiment is 3 weeks (21 days)","Life quality (SF-36), The patients will be registerd for life quality prior to ingestion of Andosan at day 1 and at day 21 after daily ingestion of Andosan for 21 days., The duration of the experiment is 3 weeks (21 days)",Egil Johnson,ImmunoPharma AS,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,10.0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,2012/1962|Egil Johnson,2016-05,2018-03,2018-04,2013-03-21,,2018-04-06,,Lillehammer,NORWAY

NCT00223639,New Medications to Treat Alcohol Dependence,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00223639,,COMPLETED,"In the last decade, there has been an explosion of new knowledge of the neuroscientific basis of alcohol-seeking behavior. Briefly, medications that modulate mesolimbic dopamine pathways by facilitating gamma amino butyric function and inhibiting the action of excitatory amino acids should reliably diminish alcohol's rewarding effects. Topiramate (a sulfamate-substituted fructo-pyranose derivative) has these characteristics. In support of this concept, we have shown in a phase-II-type medications clinical trial that topiramate is significantly superior to placebo at improving drinking outcomes and decreasing craving among (N = 150) alcohol-dependent individuals. Using the carefully controlled environment of the human laboratory, we are submitting a revised application containing a set of systematic studies to assess directly the mechanistic neuropharmacological processes that are associated with topiramate's anti-drinking effects. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol-seeking behavior and aid in the development of even more effective compounds for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Thus, the specific aims of the project are to: 1) determine the dose-relationship of acute effects of topiramate to reduce alcohol effects related to its abuse and addiction potential. We hypothesize that topiramate will reduce alcohol-induced craving, reward, and euphoria; 2) determine whether chronic treatment with an acutely effective dose of topiramate produces substantial reductions in alcohol-related cue-induced craving, thereby decreasing the potential for treatment relapse. We hypothesize that chronic topiramate administration will desensitize (reduce) alcohol craving produced by alcohol-related sensory cues; and 3) determine whether topiramate interactions with and without alcohol are associated with neurocognitive impairment. Clinical studies including ours have suggested that topiramate use may be associated with neurocognitive effects such as loss of concentration and memory impairment. In our own study, these effects were mild and not associated with reduced treatment compliance. Since alcohol's ability to produce neurocognitive impairment may be mediated through similar ionic mechanisms to that of topiramate, the proposed human laboratory setting affords us the unique opportunity to more clearly delineate topiramate's neurocognitive effects in both the presence and absence of alcohol. This study supports NIAAA's goal to develop effective medications for treating alcoholism and to understand the basic underpinnings of the disease.",NO,Alcoholism,DRUG: Topiramate,"Reduction of alcohol-induced craving,reward,and euphoria, During testing days","Reductions in alcohol-related cue-induced associated with relapse, During testing days|Determine whether topiramate interactions with and without alcohol are associated with neurocognitive impairment, During testing days",,Bankole Johnson,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)|National Institutes of Health (NIH),ALL,ADULT,PHASE2,29.0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",5R01AA014628-02|5R01AA014628-02,2005-09,2008-07,2008-07,2005-09-22,,2012-02-07,,Virginia,UNITED STATES

NCT03142984,UK Baby Study Using a Baby Wash and Lotion Regimen,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03142984,BOND,TERMINATED,"The skin of a newborn has a sensitive skin barrier relative to an older child and an adult. Newborn's skin, for example, is extremely vulnerable to damage by environmental agents such as harsh detergents, some topical oils, and other irritant chemicals. Evolving perspectives on barrier dysfunction in newborn babies has led to the idea that there may be a window of opportunity in the first few months of a newborn's life to change the environmental agents that their skin is exposed to in order to maximize skin health. These environmental changes could involve the use of optimally formulated wash products and emollients, as well as the removal of all other irritant substances that could damage the skin barrier. Further research is required to identify skincare practices that are harmful and those that are positive, and to ultimately ascertain what the optimum skincare routine should be.

An important skincare strategy is to identify an appropriate regimen (use of topical emollients and wash products) that will be used to maintain healthy skin in the future. Baby massage in particular has been shown to enhance the bond between mother and newborn, highlighting that early intervention can support skin health while also being a rewarding experience.

Gentle Touch/Early Massage:

Apply the lotion with a gentle touch to communicate love to your baby and to create a special bonding moment with skin-to-skin touch. Your touch nurtures baby's social, emotional and physical development. Please take your time to apply consciously the lotion on the whole body of your baby while engaging with her/him. Your touch, light but present, will be consistent across all the face and body areas, it is delicate and soft but more than just applying the lotion.

Parents/guardians are using products to help care for their newborn's skin and there is a need to help parents/guardians identify the most appropriate products through research.

At that first visit, they will be examined by a dentist, who will examine their mouths with a dental instrument to determine whether they qualify to participate in the trial. Someone who works for the dentist will also take some oral measurements.

Participants who qualify to be in the study will receive a treatment for their gingivitis and have an equal chance of being assigned to one of three treatment groups. Subjects in all three groups will be given toothpaste that is already available in stores. They will brush their teeth twice daily with a one-inch strip of toothpaste in their regular manner. After brushing, subjects in one group will use an experimental mouth rinse that is not available in stores. Another group will be given a mouth rinse to use that is already available in stores, and the third group will not use any mouth rinse at all. After they receive their assigned products subjects will be supervised while they brush their teeth and/or rinse to ensure they understand exactly how to use the products. All other brushing and rinsing over the next three months will be at home, but subjects will be required to keep a diary to record their brushing and rinsing times twice each day.

Subjects will be required to bring their diaries and any leftover toothpaste and mouth rinse with them for four more scheduled appointments after about 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 3 months. At those appointments, the dentist will examine their mouths, make sure there are no safety concerns, and examine again to get the measurements needed.

These suboptimal enteral and parenteral nutrition practices significantly heighten the risk of faltering postnatal growth. One promising approach to mitigate these issues is enteral DHA supplementation.

NCT04342039,Epigenetic Health Benefits of Budesonide,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04342039,Project Ace,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Around 40% of the world's population is now impacted by allergic disease and this figure continues to rise. It is now understood that allergic disease arises from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Exposure to allergens such as dust mites and pollen, as well as air pollutants such as diesel exhaust particulates, can alter the ability of critical genes to be expressed appropriately, a process known as epigenetic modification. The epigenetic modifications induced by allergens and pollutants appears to be reversible, thus providing a mechanism by which allergic disease can be treated. Budesonide (Rhinocort®) is a corticosteroid nasal spray commonly used to treat allergy symptoms. While the anti- inflammatory and other pharmacological aspects of budesonide are well understood, recent studies have suggested that budesonide may also work by reversing the epigenetic modifications caused by allergen exposure, although this has not been examined in the context of real-world exposures in humans.

This study aims to harness the power of epigenetic analysis to determine whether the epigenetic landscape in patients suffering from allergic disease can be modified by the administration of budesonide. It will fill critical gaps in understanding of epigenetic effects and provide information to examine the connection between environmental impacts and treatment effects. The research will expand the mechanistic understanding of the therapeutic effects of budesonide for relief of nasal rhinitis symptoms and may reveal new mechanisms that could improve treatment of allergies or pollution exposure, or serve as a tool for evaluating future therapies. If this venture is successful, it will serve as a model for studying and optimizing the epigenetic effects of other treatments and other diseases.",NO,Epigenetic Effects of Intranasal Steroids|Environmental Exposure,DRUG: Budesonide Nasal|OTHER: Placebo,"Budesonide affect on allergic rhinitis plus allergen (48 hrs), Change in DNA methylation in the budesonide group compared with placebo.

Atopic dermatitis occurs due to complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. One of the genes that consistenly linked with AD occurences is filaggrin gene (FLG gene).

Until now, the clinical and meta-analysis studies have shown inconsistent results, but LCPUFA intervention in early life gives more consistent and protective results.

NCT06278051,An Observational Study to Learn More About How Safe Treatment With Rivaroxaban is in Children in Japan With Venous Thromboembolism,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06278051,,COMPLETED,"This is an observational study in which only data will be collected from children with venous thromboembolism who are prescribed rivaroxaban or warfarin by their doctors.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which people have problems due to the formation of blood clots in their veins.

The study drug rivaroxaban is an approved treatment for VTE in children and adults in Japan. It is a blood thinner that prevents the blood from clotting by blocking a protein responsible for blood clotting.

Warfarin is another blood thinner that is available for VTE. In this study warfarin is the reference drug.

A previous study was carried out to learn about how well rivaroxaban works and how safe it is in children with VTE. However, to better understand the safety of this drug in children, more knowledge is needed about the use of rivaroxaban in the real world.

The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the occurrence of major bleeding in children taking rivaroxaban. Major bleeding can be bleeding within the skull, bleeding inside the eye, bleeding from an organ in the digestive system, or bleeding which requires being given blood from a donor.

In addition, this study will help learn more about the following in children with VTE:

* The occurrence of major bleeding during treatment with rivaroxaban and during treatment with warfarin
* The occurrence of bleeding of importance in children being treated with rivaroxaban and in children being treated with warfarin. Bleeding of importance in children can be: bleeding from the lung, blood in the kidney, heavy menstrual bleeding
* The occurrence of major bleeding and bleeding of importance in children who are taking drugs called anti platelet agents and NSAIDs to prevent blood clots at the same time as rivaroxaban, who are taking a drug that blocks the action of a protein called 'CYP3A4' at the same time as rivaroxaban, who have reduced kidney function, who have taken rivaroxaban for a long time, or who have taken other drugs by mouth to prevent blood clots before starting rivaroxaban

During the first 2 weeks, everyone will just brush their teeth two times a day with the fluoride toothpaste provided.

Then you will be assigned to a mouthwash group if you qualify to continue in the study. Two groups will get mouthwash with a certain amount of an experimental ingredient and one group will get a mouthwash with no experimental ingredients. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups.

For the next 6 weeks, you will rinse with your assigned mouthwash after brushing. A dentist will look at your mouth, teeth, tongue and gums and check for sensitive teeth.

The response bias score is a ratio of the number of times the participant chooses the high reward versus the low reward stimulus. Scores range from -1 to +1, with a positive score indicating a stronger bias toward the high reward stimulus.

The change in response bias is calculated by subtracting response bias during the PRT in the placebo condition from the minocycline condition.

MIM includes mindful awareness and movement from a seated position, breathing exercises, healthy sleep, and guided mindfulness meditation. The DASH component will be tailored for Black Americans. It uses a critical thinking approach that involves problem solving, participant-centered goal setting, health coaching, reflection, and development of self-efficacy (confidence) to promote physical activity and healthy eating. Solid empirical evidence demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing blood pressure among mixed-race samples.",NO,"Hypertension|Stress, Psychological",BEHAVIORAL: MIM-DASH|BEHAVIORAL: MIM Only|BEHAVIORAL: DASH Only,"Blood Pressure, Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure measured with automatic blood pressure cuff. Results outside of the normal range (90/60 to 120/80 mmHg), both higher and lower are considered undesirable., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months","Hair Cortisol, Hair cortisol (HC) will be used as a proxy for chronic stress. Approximately 25-75 mg of hair will be cut from the posterior vertex region of the scalp as close to the scalp as possible. Participants will be surveyed on corticosteroid use as these medications may suppress cortisol levels, and on their hair care practices, such as frequency of washing, chemical treatments and hair product use. Hair Cortisol levels are expressed in hair as pg/mg and generally logged due to skewed distributions as needed. Higher levels of cortisol indicated higher levels of chronic stress and a less desirable outcome., Baseline, 6 months|Block food frequency questionnaire, Block Food Frequency Questionnaire (includes physical activity) is a validated measure with a food and beverage list that includes 127 items, plus supplementary questions to allow for the adjustment of fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, and whole grain content. The questionnaire ascertains the frequency with which each food or beverage was usually consumed, and offers nine continuous responses ranging from ""never"" to ""every day"" for most foods. The DASH Index that is calculated using data from the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire uses a quintile system to score foods related to the DASH diet. All of the components are equally weighted. Intake of vegetables, fruits (including fruit juice), nuts and legumes, whole grains were scored from 1 (lowest quintile) to 5 (highest quintile). The overall DASH component scores range from 8 to 40. With higher scores indicating healthier diets, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Daily inventory of stressful events, The instrument is a semi-structured survey in which participants report whether any stressful events had occurred within the past 24 hours. This instrument yields several variables for each reported stressor including: (a) content classification of the stressor for example, work overload, argument over housework, or traffic problem); (b) subjective severity of stressors; (c) primary appraisals (areas of life that were at risk because of the stressor); and (d) perceived control of the situation."" Scores range from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate more stressful events., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Perceived stress scale (caregiver stress), The Perceived Stress Scale has 10-items one a Likert scale with a reference range of 0-30 regarding stress over the past month. Values are: 0 - Never, 1 - Almost Never, 2 - Sometimes, 3 - Fairly Often, 4 - Very Often The investigators will sum 10 items to create a composite score, ranging from 0 to 40.

The higher score, the higher levels of perceived stress., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Depression Anxiety Stress Symptom Scale (DASS-21), Assess psychological comorbidity of the caregiver and health status of the person living with ADRD. Contains 21 items to evaluate mild, moderate, or severe depression, anxiety, and stress (α =0.79).

Scores range from 0-96 with higher indicating more behavioral problems in the care recipient, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Credibility Scale, The Credibility Scale (α = 0.86) measures attitudes towards the treatment condition and the participants' expectation of benefit once the treatment has been explained. The scale consists of 5 questions rated on a 0 (not at all confident) to 10 (very confident). Higher scores, up to 45, will indicate greater credibility of the treatment condition., 3 months|Acceptability Scale, Treatment-specific preference ratings (pre- and post-intervention).The participants will complete the Acceptability of Participant Preferences 13-item Likert-type survey ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

The central clinical hypothesis for the GCC2020 study is that combining ibrutinib (BTK-inhibitor) with indoximod (IDO-inhibitor) during chemotherapy will synergistically enhance anti-tumor immune responses, leading to improvement in clinical response with manageable overlapping toxicity.

GCC2020 is a prospective open-label phase 1 trial to determine the best safe dose of ibrutinib to use in combination with a previously studied chemo-immunotherapy regimen, comprised of the IDO-inhibitor indoximod plus oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and etoposide (4-drug combination) for participants, age 6 to 25 years, with relapsed or refractory primary brain cancer.

NCT04049669,Pediatric Trial of Indoximod With Chemotherapy and Radiation for Relapsed Brain Tumors or Newly Diagnosed DIPG,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04049669,,RECRUITING,"Indoximod was developed to inhibit the IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) enzymatic pathway, which is important in the natural regulation of immune responses. This potent immune suppressive mechanism has been implicated in regulating immune responses in settings as diverse as infection, tissue/organ transplant, autoimmunity, and cancer. By inhibiting the IDO pathway, we hypothesize that indoximod will improve antitumor immune responses and thereby slow the growth of tumors.

The central clinical hypothesis for the GCC1949 study is that inhibiting the pivotal IDO pathway by adding indoximod immunotherapy during chemotherapy and/or radiation is a potent approach for breaking immune tolerance to pediatric tumors that will improve outcomes, relative to standard therapy alone.

This is an NCI-funded (R01 CA229646, MPI: Johnson and Munn) open-label phase 2 trial using indoximod-based combination chemo-radio-immunotherapy for treatment of patients age 3 to 21 years who have progressive brain cancer (glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, or ependymoma), or newly-diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Statistical analysis will stratify patients based on whether their treatment plan includes up-front radiation (or proton) therapy in combination with indoximod.

NCT03059433,Randomized Trial of a Social Networks Intervention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03059433,AVID,COMPLETED,"Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) is a college preparatory program that provides a unique opportunity to determine whether schools can reduce substance use by re-grouping at-risk students with high-performing students, while providing additional academic and emotional support. Operating in 4,837 K-12th grade schools worldwide and across 45 US states, this widely-disseminated program targets students from groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education who are currently performing in the academic middle (i.e., a 2.0-3.5 grade point average). AVID removes these students from typical classrooms and exposes them to a peer network in which academic performance and positive social norms are valued. In addition, by strengthening the student/teacher relationship, AVID expands students' networks of supportive adults. For low-income minority students in the academic middle, relatively small investments in prevention might significantly impact their academic and health trajectories. AVID capitalizes on a moment when social networks are in flux-the transition to high school-to shift these students' trajectories.

This study is a longitudinal, randomized pilot evaluation of AVID among low-income minority adolescents entering high school, comparing academic performance and drug use, as well as other risky behaviors, over 3 years. Although social networks are hypothesized to have a strong influence on behavior, few studies have tried to re-wire networks to change behaviors. This study will provide a clearer understanding of whether schools can intentionally shape networks and whether these changes can reduce substance use.

The bacteria have been seen in a high number of persons in the Baltimore area and in hospitals throughout the country. MRSA can be spread from person to person, particularly in homes and among family members and sexual partners.

First, the investigators want to find a way to prevent MRSA infections in outpatient settings. By asking questions, the investigators want to look at the things that may increase the risk of having this type of bacteria in you and your family members.

Second, the investigators have soaps and oral rinses (Chlorhexidine) and medications (antibiotics; Mupirocin ointment) that have been shown to be effective at removing MRSA. The investigators want to determine if these antibiotics and soaps are best used for everyone in the household or only the individual with known MRSA.

NCT01811407,Impacts of Public Announcements of Goals and Outcomes on Goal Completion (Commit to Steps),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01811407,,COMPLETED,"Physical activity is known to help reduce obesity and the problems that accompany it. Walking has many benefits that make it an excellent way for obese people to increase their physical activity. It is hard, however, for people to stick with walking programs. Setting specific and challenging walking targets that are combined with timely feedback about discrepancies between desired and actual performance lead to higher performance. There is conflicting theory and evidence about the effects of publicly announcing those targets on commitment to the targets and on performance.

Our research question is whether public announcements reduce the challenge level of commitments people set, and whether the reputational consequence of public announcements is severe enough to increase performance. The investigators propose a controlled trial that will integrate Facebook with the objective monitoring of walking via the use of pedometers to test the effect of public announcements on commitments and step counts.

All participants will wear a pedometer and upload via the internet for 14 to 15 weeks, depending on their date of randomization. The first 2 to 3 weeks the investigators will determine the participant's baseline step counts. The following 12 weeks, the investigators will recommend a daily step count target based on the median number of steps the participants walked the previous week. Each week, participants will set a commitment by stating the number of days in the following week that he/she will meet the computer-set step count target.

Commitments will be entered into an interface that will link with Facebook. Participants will select who of their Facebook friends will receive their commitments and/or results via Facebook posts. The interface will distribute those posts in a way that fits in with existing online social practices.

There will be 3 experimental conditions. 1.) No public announcements 2.) Public announcement of commitment and 3.) Public announcement of commitment and results. In addition, groups 2 and 3 will provide us with emails of 3 friends or family members who will act as the participant's support team. The investigators will send announcements directly to support team members.

The investigators plan to recruit 165 participants primarily by obtaining lists of potentially eligible University of Michigan Health System patients from the clinical data repository, and sending targeted letters to these patients.

NCT01650337,mFit: The Mobile Fitness Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01650337,mFIT,COMPLETED,"BACKGROUND: The nascent field of mobile health (mHealth) is expanding with impressive speed. In March 2012, experts estimated that 40,000 health related smartphone applications were on the market but little is known about the effectiveness of these programs. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated whether weight loss can be successfully achieved through use of a smartphone application or how these applications could be used in primary care practice.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a popular, free smartphone application for weight loss and calorie counting in a primary care setting.

METHODS: The first phase of this study involved a community based participatory approach to select the intervention. Patient focus groups were conducted and analyzed to explore patients' preferences regarding various text-message versus smartphone programs. The second phase of this study, described here, will be a randomized controlled trial with overweight primary care patients exposed to one of two conditions for 6 months: (1) usual care; (2) usual care plus smartphone application, which includes instructing participants on how to use the application and encouraging them to use the applications' reminders and social networking features. The primary outcome of interest is weight change at 3 and 6 months. Two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare weight change between groups, as appropriate. ANCOVA models will be used to examine weight change after adjusting for covariates such as education, sex and age. Repeated measures analysis will be carried out to compare weight change between the groups using baseline, 3 month and 6 month data. In addition to an intent-to-treat analysis, the investigators will also conduct a ""treatment received"" analysis, adjusting for the extent of application use in both the intervention and control arms.

NCT01616628,The Use of Incentives to Promote Healthier Eating in Low-income Communities,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01616628,,COMPLETED,"Identifying effective strategies for improving healthier eating for low- income populations is both a clinical challenge and a public health priority. Approximately one-fifth of the children in the United States are either overweight or obese. Obesity is even more common in low- income populations as are other related health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.

The consumption of fruits and vegetables is strongly associated with the prevention and management of obesity and diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Overall, only about 38% of Americans consume the recommended servings of vegetables and only 23% consume the suggested amount of fruit. Close to 20% of low- income households do not purchase fruits and vegetables at all.

The proposed research offers an opportunity to investigate a different approach to incentives for healthier eating in a low-income urban population. Specifically, this study will examine a rewards-based incentive for fruit and vegetable purchases with rewards based on cumulative purchases. Previous studies have shown that incentives may be an effective means of promoting behavior change. The proposed study will provide essential data about the impact of targeted incentives to promote acquisition of fruits and vegetables by individuals living in households with young children. The investigators plan to design a subsequent, larger study based on the results of this study. In the proposed study, the investigators will specifically contribute to this knowledge by investigating the effects of rewards-based incentives that provide delayed reinforcement.

SPECIFIC AIMS AND STUDY HYPOTHESES

The goal of this study is to investigate whether incentives to low-income families to encourage purchase of healthier foods can be used to help stem the tide of childhood obesity. Although this study is a randomized trial, a major function is collecting data to be used in the design of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing two different interventions using incentives to promote healthier eating in low-income communities. The investigators will test a supermarket ""gift card"" with rewards based on purchases of fruits and vegetables during the intervention periods. The specific objective is to determine whether that incentive system-(where the rewards can be used to purchase anything in that supermarket) increases healthier food purchasing practices by low-income families. The primary outcomes are: number of servings, and percent of total food dollars spent on fruits and vegetables (fresh and frozen). The primary hypotheses are:

1. Households in the intervention group will purchase more fruits and vegetables than controls per week, both during: a) each intervention phase as compared to the baseline period and b) in the follow up phase compared to the baseline period. (Between group comparisons over time of intervention versus control group)

It has been proposed to be associated with the development of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. As these are conditions that have long term maternal and neonatal implications, further information may help improve maternal/fetal outcome. One reason why women and in particular pregnant women are under diagnosed is the lack of an effective, reliable screening tool. Validated questionnaires used in the general population may not be effective in screening pregnant women. The investigators hypothesize that sleep apnea will have 20% prevalence in the obese pregnant population and that it is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity. The investigators will recruit obese pregnant women in their prenatal care clinics and they will be screened for OSA using validated sleep questionnaires including the Epworth sleepiness scale, the Fatigue Scale and the Berlin Questionnaire.

This 4-year study is designed: (1) to teach primary care physicians how to recognize low health literacy patients and effectively counsel them on cancer screening using risk communication and shared decision making and (2) to assess the impact of training on changes in physician communication behavior and changes in low health literacy patients' cancer screening behaviors. This study proposal is based on the hypothesis that physician training in cancer screening guidelines, health literacy, and communication skills will improve provider-patient interactions during encounters dealing with preventive health maintenance especially cancer screening.

How will the proposed study be implemented? Thirty-two physicians in the New Orleans metropolitan area will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of two groups. The unit of randomization will be the health care organization or clinic. The intervention group will receive training in health literacy, cancer screening, risk communication and shared decision-making.

Each physician assigned to the intervention group will receive verbal feedback on communication skills from the standardized patients and complete a web-based tutorial. Physicians in the control group will not have access to the web-based tutorial until the end of the study.

This research will investigate the function of the adenosine deaminase (ADA) in subjects with sleep disorders. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing adenosine, a neuromodulator that is released during periods of sleep apnea and that has been found to promote vascular thrombosis. There are multiple types of ADA that are genetically determined and have different levels of function. Those different forms of this enzyme may determine groups that are more susceptible to the development of thrombosis.

This project will target patients who have already developed pressure-related cardiac structural abnormalities yet remain symptom free.

NCT00286598,Feet First: Promoting Physical Activity Among People With Diabetes Mellitus and Insensate Feet,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00286598,,COMPLETED,"The role of weight-bearing physical activity in the development of diabetic foot ulcers remains poorly understood. Regular participation in moderately intense physical activity (e.g. brisk walking ) reduces 8-year cardiovascular mortality in those with diabetes mellitus by over 30%. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends at least 30 minutes of daily moderate intensity activity for people with diabetes. However, the ADA recommends that people with diabetes and insensate feet, which affects up to 40% of those with diabetes, should limit their walking because of concerns that walking could increase the risk of foot ulcers and amputation. Firm evidence is lacking to support these concerns; in fact, while a research fellow I conducted an observational study that showed daily weight-bearing activity may reduce the risk of foot ulceration among people with diabetic foot problems. A controlled clinical trial is needed to study these issues further.

The present study is a randomized controlled trial in 100 older adults with diabetes and insensate feet, 50 of whom will participate in an individually-tailored behavior-change intervention called ""Feet First"", and 50 of whom will be controls. The intervention is based on the extensively-tested CHAMPS model used by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Active for Life Program. Feet First extends the target population beyond older adults generally to people with insensate feet due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

The specific aims of the study are:

In addition, we will test the impact of varying types of counseling and social support on the adoption and maintenance of regular physical activity and help women improve their weight control. The core behavioral change program will be based on a comprehensive wellness oriented website offered by the National Black Women's Health Project (NBWHP). Comparisons will be made between the effects of the web-based program with only minimal face to face contacts, primarily for enrollment, data collection, and participant retention, the web-based program with the addition of telephone counseling and support, and the web-based program with face to face group counseling and support.

Hypotheses. Hypothesis 1. Participation in the intervention will result in increased physical activity levels, regardless of the level of social support.

Hypothesis 2. The intervention arm involving the lowest level of social support will be marginally effective for increasing physical activity levels, and additional social support will result in significantly improved physical activity levels when compared with the lowest level of social support.

The specific intervention questions are:

1. How well do the interventions address the program objectives ((quality of implementation), to be determined through protocol review for operationalization of theoretical constructs)?
2. Was the program implemented as planned ((fidelity to protocol and dose of intervention), to be determined from implementation process variables, including characteristics of women recruited, fidelity to protocols for contact with participants, and quality of counseling given, where applicable)?
3. Did the program (separately for each format tested) have a significant effect on potential mediators of behavior change (influence on presumed intermediate outcomes)?

4. What is the optimum type of counseling and support to enhance the on-line activities in order to produce significant behavior change (importance of various program components)?
5. Did the program (separately for each format tested) have a significant effect on the primary study outcomes (influence on primary behavioral outcome, e.g., physical activity by self-report of activity levels or pedometer counts)?
6. Do changes in mediators explain changes in the primary outcomes (multivariate models to understand if presumed process of behavioral change was observed in practice)?

We hypothesize that ME along with biofeedback will increase the rate of validated smoking cessation at 8 months gestation by at least 10 percentage points above that produced by ""Best Practice"" (BP) counseling alone. This study will also examine reduction of smoking among non-quitters and maintenance of smoking cessation through 6 weeks postpartum among women who quit.

Prenatal smoking is the leading preventable cause of low birth weight in the US. Reduction in smoking during pregnancy could result in significant improvements in pregnancy outcomes and reducing the cost of health care. There is evidence that low-intensity pregnancy smoking cessation programs may be inadequate for women who are more addicted, and at educational and economic disadvantage. Motivational enhancement strategies have shown considerable promise in the treatment of addictive behaviors.

NCT01058980,ADenosine Following Pulmonary Vein Isolation to Target Dormant Conduction Elimination: the ADVICE Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01058980,ADVICE,COMPLETED,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, impairs quality of life and increases stroke risk and mortality. Despite advances in medical treatment, AF remains uncontrolled in many patients. In many patients, AF is initiated by abnormal electrical impulses from the pulmonary veins. A catheter ablation procedure called pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has therefore been developed, using heat to isolate the PV foci from the heart. PVI is very effective, but must be repeated in up to 50% of cases because the foci isolation is not permanent after initial PVI. The intravenous administration of a drug called adenosine during the PVI procedure can unmask residual conduction that would otherwise remain unnoticed, so-called ""dormant conduction"". In our experience, additional ablation guided by adenosine reduces AF recurrence and the need for a repeat PVI procedure. However, the adenosine-guided approach has not yet been proven as standard therapy. The present study, to be conducted at 15 clinical centres in Canada, Europe and Australia is therefore intended to evaluate the efficacy of adenosine-guided ablation to prevent AF recurrence. Five hundred twenty-six patients will be included in the study, which should be completed within 2 years. In all patients, the presence of dormant conduction will be tested with adenosine during PVI. If dormant conduction is observed, additional ablation will be performed in half of these patients selected randomly. If there is no dormant conduction, randomly selected patients will be followed in a registry. If the adenosine-guided approach is demonstrated to improve the success rate of PVI procedures, it should become the standard approach for a ""permanent cure"" of AF, and therefore benefit patients by reducing arrhythmia recurrence, hospitalizations and the need for repeat interventions.",NO,Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation|Pulmonary Vein Isolation|Dormant Pulmonary Vein Conduction,PROCEDURE: Additional ablation until elimination of dormant conduction|PROCEDURE: No additional ablation|PROCEDURE: Registry group|PROCEDURE: Usual medical care,"Time to first recurrence of electrocardiographically documented, symptomatic AF or atrial flutter/tachycardia between 3 and 12 months post ablation in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug therapy., The primary outcome is time to first recurrence of symptomatic ECG-documented AF or atrial flutter/tachycardia between days 91 \& 365 after ablation, or repeat ablation procedure during the first 90 days.

NCT00186602,Does a Peer Navigator Improve Quality of Life at Diagnosis for Women With Breast Cancer?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00186602,,COMPLETED,"Women indicate the greatest needs for counseling at the time of initial diagnosis for primary breast cancer. The time of initial diagnosis is also often the time of greatest need for information for women and their families. However, this is the time when a woman, overwhelmed by shock and trauma, is least likely to absorb information provided or seek new sources of information. An informed peer navigator with carefully trained communication skills can judge the level of information to disclose and pace that information in a way that can be easily absorbed and understood. She will also provide support. WomenCARE, a well-established Santa Cruz agency providing free support services for women with cancer, and the Psychosocial Treatment Lab at Stanford therefore ask whether women newly diagnosed with breast cancer will improve their quality of life by participating in a peer navigator program. WomenCARE's peer navigators provide emotional support, good listening skills, and information on resources for women just diagnosed with breast cancer. Having a peer counselor while a woman goes through treatment may reduce the magnitude of distress or shorten its time course. It may also reduce distress in family members, and improve relationships with medical personnel.

This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer navigator program where a woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer is carefully matched for 3 to 6 months after diagnosis with a trained volunteer who is herself a breast cancer survivor. Navigators and Sojourners (newly diagnosed women) are matched on things that are important to them. Women often want to be matched on the type of surgery or treatment they have received. We assign half of the women (by a process similar to a coin toss) to our peer navigator program and half to a group that receives standard medical care but no peer navigator. In this way we can compare the groups to see whether those matched with a peer navigator have better quality of life over the 3 to 6 month period. All women who join our study, regardless of the group to which they are assigned, get an extra consultation with a nurse specialist at a local hospital. In this consultation, the nurse reviews the cancer resources available to the woman in Santa Cruz County.

NCT00948714,Support for Cardiovascular Health in African American Primary Care Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00948714,,COMPLETED,"Project Overview:

Poor hypertension control has dire consequences for the African-American population who suffer greater death and disability from heart disease, stroke, and renal failure than whites. To reduce these health disparities it is critical to promote of a healthy lifestyle in regard to diet, exercise, adherence to medications, as well as other behaviors. However, physicians usually fail to address lifestyle behaviors in the context of the harried patient visit. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the investigators could reduce cardiovascular risk by providing additional support to persons with poorly controlled hypertension through phone calls from trained peer patients and visits to an office support staff member.

Study Design:

A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 280 African-American primary care patients aged 40-75 with poorly controlled hypertension (HTN). The intervention group receives a practice-based team intervention that combines peer coach with office staff (i.e., medical assistant or licensed practice nurse) visits to address lifestyle challenges. Both intervention and control groups receive informational materials and healthy soul food recipes from the American Heart Association. The 6 month intervention alternates monthly phone calls from peer coaches about lifestyle behavioral changes with office-based visits with the support staff member during which patients review and discuss low literacy slide shows about healthy behaviors as well as examine their personal cardiovascular risk profile.",NO,Cardiovascular Diseases|Blood Pressure,BEHAVIORAL: Peer Coach Phone Calls|BEHAVIORAL: Health Educator Visits|OTHER: written materials,"Greater reduction in CHD risk in case group vs. control, 6 months","5mm reduction in systolic blood pressure in case group, 6 months",,University of Pennsylvania,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|Pfizer,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,130.0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,808214,2008-05,2010-12,2011-01,2009-07-29,,2017-07-21,,Pennsylvania,UNITED STATES
NCT06179758,Remote MS Care in Antwerp,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06179758,ReMSCA,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Current clinical follow-up of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients suffers from some challenges, as many patients indicate they want to take up a more active role in the decision-making process. However, more than half of MS patients do not consider themselves well informed about their disease. Communication between patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) has also been reported to be suboptimal, with incorrect alignment between patients and HCPs as a result and relapses going undetected. Digital telemonitoring tools could play a role in educating MS patients, allowing them to take up a more active role in the clinical decision-making process. Additionally, remote monitoring could lead to a better alignment between patient and HCPs and could ultimately even lead to a more efficient clinical workflow.

In this study, the investigators will investigate an existing digital telemonitoring solution called icompanion, developed by Icometrix. icompanion is a class 1 medical device in US (Food and Drug Administration - FDA) and Europe (Medical Device Directive - MDD). Using the icompanion MS app and website, patients can keep a diary, log symptoms, and perform tests for body function, cognitive function and fatigue based on clinically validated patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In addition, MS patients can add treatment information, from disease modifying therapies (DMTs) to symptomatic and rehabilitation treatments, and set reminders on when to take or perform their treatment. Furthermore, patients can easily upload their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (via the patient website) and view them (via the patient website and app) as well as learn about topics related to MS (e.g., MS types, MRI lesions). Finally, patients can prepare their consultations using a pre-visit checklist, the answers of which are also shared with the patient's clinical team.

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility to use this app in a population of 100 MS patients in Antwerp, in three clinical centres. For this, the following objectives have been set forth:

* The primary objective is to evaluate the usability and acceptance of a digital remote monitoring solution for MS (icompanion).
* The secondary objectives are:

  1. To evaluate the relationship between MS patients' subjective health experience, disease control and disease acceptation (by using the Health Monitor) and adherence and usability
  2. To evaluate the impact of the use of the solution on the Health Monitor profile (reflecting patients' subjective health experience, disease control and disease acceptation) in a pre- versus post-intervention analysis
  3. To evaluate the impact of the solution on the MS patients' disease self-management, by use of the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Management Scale-Revised (MSSM-R)
  4. To evaluate the impact of the solution on the clinical visit workflow, by using visual analogue scales with custom questions about impact on workflow
* The tertiary objectives are:

  1. To evaluate the concordance between patient-reported and clinician-assessed values of some of the parameters collected by the icompanion default dataset (e.g., patient-reported Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), daily steps), when available

The general hypothesis is that bovine lactoferrin reduces some of the previously observed differences between formula-fed and breast-fed infants with regard to health and development. The main outcome studied is the effect on immune function. The second aim is to study the effects of lower iron concentration in infant formula and to test the hypothesis that iron can be lowered without negative effects on health and development. The main outcome studied here is iron status. Other outcomes in this trial are microbiota composition, metabolomics, growth, body composition and cognitive development.

To test the lactoferrin hypothesis, formula-fed infants will be recruited and fed a low iron (2 mg/L) control formula, or the same formula supplemented with bovine lactoferrin. To test the iron hypothesis, a third group will be fed the same formula (no lactoferrin) with higher iron concentration (8 mg/L). Group allocation for all formula-fed infants will be double-blind randomized. Additionally, breast-fed infants will be recruited and used as a reference group (gold standard).",NO,Health of Formula-fed Children|Infant Infections in Formula-fed Children|Iron Status of Formula-fed Children,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Formula with low iron concentration (2 mg/L) supplemented with bovine lactoferrin|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Formula with low iron concentration (2mg/L) without lactoferrin|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Formula with normal iron concentration (8 mg/L) without lactoferrin,"Incidence of infections, Morbidity journal, Health questionnaire, Up to 12 months of age|Cytokine levels, IL-2, TNF-alpha, At 6 months of age|Iron status, s-ferritin, s-transferrin, s-iron, s-transferrin receptor concentration, reticulocyte Hb, At 6 months of age","Dietary intake, Dietary journal, At baseline, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 12 months of age|Growth, Anthropometric data, Body Composition (PeaPod), At baseline, 4, 6, 12 months of age and 6 years of age|Bloodpressure, At baseline, 4, 6, 12 months of age and 6 years of age|Antibody response to vaccines, s-levels of specific antibodies to vaccines (DTP, Hib, PC), At baseline, 4, 6 and 12 months of age|Gut microbiota, Stool samples, At baseline, 4, 6, 12 months of age and 6 years of age|Saliva proteins, Saliva total protein content, lactoferrin, saliva-peroxidase, IgA and amylase, At 4 months of age|Inflammatory markers, s-hsCRP, s-calprotectin, At baseline, 4, 6 and 12 months of age and 6 years age|Cognitive development and behavior, Bayley III, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Behavioral questionnaire, At 1 and 6 years of age|s-hepcidin, At baseline, 4, 6, 12 months of age and 6 years of age|Metabolomics, Analyzed in urine and serum samples, At baseline, 4, 6, 12 months of age and 6 years of age|Amino acids, p-amino acids, At 4 and 6 months of age|Blood urea nitrogen, p-urea nitrogen, At 4 and 6 months of age|Cytokine levels, IL-2 and TNF alpha at baseline, 4 and 12 months of age and 6 years of age.

NCT01492257,Shared Decision Making in Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Hip and Knee,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01492257,SDM,COMPLETED,"Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is an effective procedure for reducing pain and improving function in patients with disabling osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. However, as with all invasive procedures, TJA is associated with certain risks and substantial costs. Since the indications for TJA are heavily dependent on patients' quality of life and expectations. TJA utilization rates vary widely throughout the United States, as seen with other 'preference-sensitive' procedures. Early evidence suggests shared decision making (SDM) strategies are effective in enhancing patient decision quality, or the degree to which treatment decisions reflect the preferences of fully informed patients, especially for preference-sensitive procedures like TJA. Despite these advantages, however, SDM has not been embraced or widely adopted in orthopaedics. To investigate this limited uptake, the investigators propose a series of evaluations of individual-level strategies. The investigators innovative and unique contribution is to approach patients, surgeons and healthcare purchasers as having symmetric and equally valid concerns about the benefits and cost associated with SDM. The investigators overall objective is to facilitate wider dissemination of SDM strategies in orthopaedic practices. The specific aims of the project are to assess, for SDM strategies, the impact on key patient, surgeon, and healthcare purchaser priorities; By achieving this aim our project will produce new interventions and incentives for disseminating SDM that are endorsed as feasible and acceptable by a coalition of patients, surgeons, and purchasers.

NCT02390973,Surgery Versus Best Medical Management for the Long Term Remission of Type 2 Diabetes and Related Diseases (REMISSION),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02390973,REMISSION,RECRUITING,"Bariatric surgery procedures induce weight loss through restriction and/or malabsorption. The mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes remission and others metabolic improvements after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) have not yet been formally studied. The investigators propose a longitudinal study with the overall objective of measuring the long-term impact of these three bariatric surgeries (RYGB, SG, BPD-DS) on metabolic, renal and cardiovascular fate in patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators overall hypothesis is that some bariatric procedures generate hitherto unrecognized effects on many disease-related outcomes, which greatly contributes to their beneficial impact in diabetic patients. The investigators propose 3 specific aims: 1) to establish the long term effect of the three surgeries on the metabolic recovery and quality of life in groups of diabetic patients treated with insulin, hypoglycemic agents or diet; 2) to establish the long term impact of the three surgeries on renal and cardiovascular functions in subgroup of patients with these conditions; 3) to compare metabolic impact of surgeries to those of best medical care for diabetes in a non-surgical control group. For most severely obese patients, lifestyle interventions, perhaps effective in inducing short-lived weight losses, are ineffective for long-term weight loss maintenance and durable metabolic recovery. The increasing popularity of obesity surgeries calls for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This is especially true and urgent when considering that knowledge on the relative impact of each procedure (i.e. SG vs. RYGB and BPD-DS) in resolving T2D is still limited.

NCT02069223,Physiological Impact of Each Component of the Biliopancreatic Diversion With Duodenal Switch and Sleeve Gastrectomy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02069223,,UNKNOWN,"Bariatric surgery procedures promote weight loss by limiting the amount of food consumed through reduction of the size of the stomach and by decreasing absorption of nutrients through reorganizing or bypassing portions of the small intestine. Among the procedures used to induce weight loss, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) was initially developed in the early 90's as the restrictive component of a biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS). It was then offered by laparoscopy as a staged-approach in order to reduce peri-operative complications in high-risk patients. The second step of the surgery (i.e. the duodenal switch) was planned when sufficient weight loss had been obtained. However, it was observed that some patients experienced appreciable weight loss with the SG alone, and did not require a second-stage surgery, thus avoiding the side-effects of a malabsorptive surgery. This led to the surge in popularity of SG as a stand-alone operation, because of its relative technical simplicity, feasibility, and good outcomes. Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to induce metabolic recovery and weight loss following surgery. The independent effects of each component of the BPD-DS with SG have never been investigated in humans within a well-controlled study design. The general objective of the present project is to assess the impact of each component of the BPD-DS and SG, either combined of separated, on physiological variables potentially responsible for metabolic recovery. Patients will be randomized to undergo one of three surgical sequences: 1) SG followed by BPD-DS one year later; 2) BPD-DS followed by SG one year later; or 3) SG and BPD-DS within a single operation. A series of tests will be performed at baseline, at 1 year, and 2 years after the initial surgery.

NCT02068833,Resolution of Microalbuminuria and Dysmetabolism Following Bariatric Surgery: Prospective Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02068833,,UNKNOWN,"Favorable effects of bariatric surgery have been demonstrated in particular regarding increased insulin sensitivity, decreased blood pressure, improved blood lipids and decreased cardiovascular risk. After surgery, weight loss also leads to improvement of the chronic inflammatory state related to obesity, a strong predictor of the metabolic status. Although obese patients are often affected with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, both related to renal impairment, the existence of a distinct mechanism by which obesity would cause chronic renal insufficiency has been suggested. The mechanisms underlying obesity-related nephropathy have been proposed to involve hyperfiltration, expansion of mesangial cells, hyperperfusion leading to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, as noted in obese dogs. In humans, improvements in renal function may be observed following bariatric surgery, although some reported a possibility of increased nephrolithiases. Whether biliopancreatic diversion and gastrectomy alone have similar effects is uncertain. More prospective studies are needed to assess the impact of all types of weight loss surgery to reverse chronic renal insufficiency.

The objective of this study is to document changes in microalbuminuria and metabolic parameters in patients with altered renal function undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients enrolled in the study will show renal function impairment as demonstrated by albumin/creatinine ratio alterations in 2 out of 3 measurements taking place before surgery. We will perform a prospective study of renal function markers (albumin/creatinine ratio) and metabolic parameters (blood lipids, glucose, insulin, inflammatory markers) before and 6, 12, 24 months after surgery in patients with microalbuminuria at study onset (albumin/creatinine ratio 2.0-20.0 mg/mmol in men and 2.8-28.0 mg/mmol in women). Data will be analysed with repeated measures analyses in both subgroup. Thereafter, a linear regression model will be created to adjust for potentially confounding factors such as hypertension and diabetes.

NCT01580332,Non-Invasive Biomarkers For Early Detection Of Lung Cancers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01580332,ISRUSAL01,COMPLETED,"Recent studies have shown that low-dose chest CT scans can detect lung cancers in high-risk populations (age \>50yo, \>30 pack-years of tobacco use), and can lower cancer mortality. Unfortunately, the vast majority of ""positive"" findings on these CT scans are benign (\>95%). Currently, an inordinate amount of expensive follow-up testing is required for these patients to try to prove who among them truly has a cancer.

Several new emerging non-invasive and potentially cheaper tests are now being investigated to help differentiate patients with cancers versus just benign lung nodules. These new tests include a new type of sputum analysis, a breath analysis, a blood test measuring certain tumor markers, a blood test looking for auto-antibodies, and a standard PET/CT scan. Each of these tests have different sensitivity and specificity rates when looking for lung cancer, and it is unclear which test is best.

This study will employ a panel of all 5 of these non-invasive tests on an initial cohort of 50 patients with recently diagnosed lung cancer to try to measure the sensitivity of the tests. A follow-on study will then perform the same panel of tests on 300 lung nodule patients to see which test, or combination of tests, gives the best overall accuracy in terms of predicting who really has lung cancer. It is hoped that the use of such a panel could lead to dramatically decreased need for expensive and morbid invasive testing for this population.",NO,Lung Cancer,,,,,"Douglas W.

NCT05669170,Methylphenidate for Apathy in Veterans With Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05669170,MAV-PD,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Apathy is one of the most common behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Patients with apathy show diminution in motivation and goal-directed behaviors, which is a fundamental aspect of human functioning, affecting dependency and quality of life. Although apathy is thought to be potentially treatable currently there are no effective treatments for apathy. Given the higher incidence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities, the Veterans Affairs health system represents a unique population for which medication response may be different from the general population. This study aims to evaluate if a medication that has already been proven to be useful in Alzheimer's disease patients with apathy, could be helpful in Parkinson's disease as well as decreasing its debilitating consequences and reducing patients' dependency on caregivers, providing well-deserved relief to patients and their loved ones.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Apathy,BEHAVIORAL: Psychosocial intervention|DRUG: Methylphenidate,"Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), This measure is an 18-item scale initially developed as a method for measuring apathy resulting from brain-related pathology., 6 weeks|Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), The CGIC is a systematic method, developed for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) setting to assess clinically significant change in a clinical trial as viewed by an independent, skilled, and experienced clinician and has been used as an outcome in Parkinson disease trials, 6 weeks","Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), This scale was developed specifically to assess cognitive functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease but has also been used in Parkinson disease.65 It is widely used in clinical trials, and its sensitivity in detecting cognitive changes has been demonstrated in a number of studies. Scores are obtained for orientation, word-list recall, and recognition, object naming, ability to follow simple requests, ideational and constructional praxis, and expressive language. Higher scores indicate worse performance., 6 weeks|Continuous Performance Test (CPT), The CPT was developed to study vigilance or selective attention. In its original form, letters were presented to participants visually one at a time at a fixed rate. The subjects were to press a lever whenever the target letter X appeared and to not press the lever if any other letter was shown. This is called the X-CPT version, and Beck et al found that this version had adequate classification accuracy. Various modifications of the basic X-CPT have been adopted, including changing the target to a number or picture, or a letter series. The CPT version used for this study will be Conner's CPT Version II. The targets are letters and patients do not respond to the letter X (not-X-CPT)., 6 weeks|Trail Making Test (TMT), The TMT is composed of visual search and sequencing tasks that are heavily influenced by executive functioning (concentration, resistance to distraction, and cognitive flexibility/set-shifting) and attention. These easily administered tasks are extremely sensitive to neuropsychological deficits such as frontal lobe deficits, problems with psychomotor speed, visual search, and sequencing deficits. The Test has two parts: A and B. In Part A, subjects connect numbers in order on a piece of paper as quickly as possible. Part A provides a baseline for processing speed for interpretation of the second part, Part B. For Part B, subjects connect numbers and letters alternately in order such that the connections are 1-A-2-B-3-C and so on. Both parts are timed. Lower times are better., 6 weeks|Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), The NPI assesses the type and severity of behavioral disturbances in dementia. The inventory evaluates 12 domains of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS): apathy, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, depression, euphoria, aberrant motor behavior, irritability, disinhibition, anxiety, sleeping, and eating. Frequency (1 = occasionally, less than once/week; 2 = often, about once per week; 3 = frequently, more than once a week; 4 = very frequently, once or more/day or continuously) and severity (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) scales in each domain are scored based on responses from an informed caregiver involved in the patient's life. The NPI also includes a 5-point rating used to quantify caregiver distress with the patient's NPS symptoms. To obtain an NPI score for each domain, the severity score and the frequency score are multiplied, and the caregiver distress ratings of each domain are added up., 6 weeks|Starkstein Apathy Scale (SAS), The AS consists of 14 items phrased as questions that are to be answered on a four-point Likert scale. Total score range is 0-42; higher scores indicate more severe apathy.This scale is derived from AES and is tailored to PD. It has been widely validated for the use of Apathy in PD and is recommended by the Movement Disorders Society, 6 weeks|Dementia Apathy Interview Rating (DAIR), The DAIR is a structured interview administered to a caregiver. The rationale to include in the trial is to maintain consistency with the ADMET trial, which will help with comparison between groups. It consists of 29 questions concerning the initiation of behavior, interest, and engagement with the environment. Each interview question consists of two parts. The first part addresses issues of frequency on a four-point scale, with 0 signaling the absence of the behavior and 3 signaling the constant presence of the behavior. The second part of the question asks if the current behavior represents a change from the behavior prior to memory loss. The apathy score is a sum of all items reflecting change, divided by the number of items completed, with higher scores representing greater average apathy. Dividing by the number of items adjusts for the number of behaviors for which there has been a change and expresses the patient's apathy score in terms of the underlying 4-point scale (0-3)., 6 weeks|Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), This measure is an ADL inventory developed by the ADCS to assess functional performance in patients with AD but has also been used in PD. In a structured interview format that requires less than 15 minutes to administer, informants are queried as to whether subjects attempted each of 24 items in the inventory during the prior 4 weeks and their level of performance. The scale discriminates well the stages of severity of patients, from very mild to severely impaired. It has good test-retest reliability. It includes items from traditional basic ADL scales (e.g., grooming, dressing, walking, bathing, feeding, toileting) as well as instrumental activities of daily living scales (e.g., shopping, preparing meals, using household appliances, keeping an appointment, reading). The ADCS-ADL inventory has been used as an outcome measure in other PD clinical trials., 6 weeks|Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in PD (QUIP), Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are often seen in association with apathy in PD. Dopaminergic medications are considered one of the main mechanisms for the development of impulse control disorders, such as gambling. Given the NPI does not address ICDs another screening tool needs to be added. The QUIP is a widely used questionnaire used for screening of ICDs, The total QUIP-RS score for all ICDs and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112 with higher number indicating more severe and/or frequent impulse control disorders., 6 weeks|Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) - Part III and IV, The MDS-UPDRS is one of the most commonly used scales to monitor symptoms related to Parkinson disease.

NCT00668590,Improving Diabetes Care With Patient Decision Aids - A Trial in Community-based Primary Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00668590,,COMPLETED,"Mounting evidence documents the positive impact of using patient decision aids (PtDA) to facilitate shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and physicians in preference sensitive contexts. But overall use of PtDAs across the broader US healthcare system remains low. More compelling evidence is needed to make the case for policies that would accelerate adoption of PtDAs in routine clinical practice in primary care settings that serve diverse and economically disadvantaged populations. The investigators believe that it is now time to move beyond the subjective evaluations of PtDAs that are commonly reported in clinical trials of PtDAs, to evaluate whether these tools can also change health behavior and improve health outcomes. Therefore, the investigators will build on their expertise in working with community-based physicians to evaluate a newly developed PtDA focused on diabetes, using a mixed-methods approach. The investigators patient sample will be drawn from primary care practices serving African American, Latino and Caucasian patients. The investigators will conduct a 2-group randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of the diabetes PtDA, combined with telephone coaching, in increasing patient self-care and self-efficacy, increasing diabetes knowledge and improving clinical measures including glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, lipids and blood pressure. The investigators will also explore variation in effects of the patient decision aid, comparing African American, Latino and Caucasian patients and conduct in-depth interviews with a randomly selected subset of trial participants to explore patient perceptions of the decision aid and variation across racial/ethnic groups. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to the control condition, participants assigned to receiving the video PtDA program and telephone coaching will report: greater self-efficacy and diabetes knowledge, more engagement in self-care behaviors, better glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c, as well as lower quantitative LDL and blood pressure levels. The conceptual model guiding the investigators trial is the Integrative Model of Behavior Change. The model includes three primary determinants of behavior:

1. attitudes toward performing the behavior
2. perceived social norms about performing the behavior
3. self-efficacy.

Despite existing secondary prevention therapies, recurrent ischemic events are common following a TIA. Given the risk of poor outcomes and the important role of the generalist, new therapeutic approaches for patients with TIA are needed that can be applied by generalists to outpatients. This research will develop and evaluate a new therapeutic approach that centers on the observations that sleep-disordered breathing is a risk factor for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, is common in patients with cerebrovascular disease, and is associated with poor outcome following a stroke or TIA. We posit that diagnosing and treating sleep-disordered breathing in the home of TIA patients can improve cerebrovascular and cardiovascular outcomes.

The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of periodontal therapy on endothelial function assessed by Flow mediated dilatation (FMD).

The rationale for this project is twofold:

* Establish the extent of acute systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction associated with the delivery of subgingival instrumentation for the treatment of chronic periodontitis
* Establish whether or not improved control of chronic periodontal infections results in improved endothelial function and thus the existence of a causal association between periodontitis and endothelial dysfunction.",NO,Periodontitis,PROCEDURE: Intensive periodontal therapy|PROCEDURE: Community based periodontal therapy,Flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery,Serum inflammatory and endothelial function markers,,Eastman Dental Insitute and Hospital,"University College London Hospitals|British Heart Foundation|The European Research Group on Periodontology (ERGOPerio)|Johnson & Johnson|CORDA, The Heart Charity|European Social Fund|Italian Society of Periodontology",ALL,ADULT,PHASE3,120.0,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,UCLH03/E007,2003-09,,2005-03,2006-05-18,,2006-05-18,,London,UNITED KINGDOM

NCT05940337,FIT to Grow Old - Functionality of the Immune System and Healthy Aging,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05940337,FTGO,COMPLETED,"Aging is commonly associated with reduced functionality of the immune system, resulting in a higher prevalence of infectious disease, auto-immune disease, cancer, and lower efficiency of vaccination. Nutritional strategies are increasingly recognized as a method to improve immune functionality, as several nutrients are shown to exert immunomodulatory properties. However, the large variation between individuals with regard to immune responses asks for more personalized approaches. Therefore, this field of research would benefit from a selection of those individuals with immune dysfunction. It is recently shown that immune functionality is largely dependent on intracellular metabolism, leading to the introduction of the new term 'immune cell fitness' which combines the metabolic and functional status of an immune cell. Within this study, we will determine the immune cell fitness of monocytes from healthy young adults and elderly subjects by measuring and integrating a broad range of metabolic and functional immune parameters into an immune cell fitness score. We aim to identify those individuals with immune dysfunction, the unfit.

NCT04614610,Lidocaine Intravenous in the Emergency Department For Sickle Cell Crisis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04614610,RELIEF-SCC,UNKNOWN,"Sickle cell crisis continues to be a frequent presentation to emergency departments. Patients presenting will often require immediate treatment for their pain and often times this will include opioids. The opioid epidemic has cost thousands of lives; and continues to be a significant problem posing several challenges when treating patients presenting with sickle cell disease. Primarily, opioids remain the mainstay of treatment for these patients and the push to address the opioid crisis may present challenges for adequate opioid administration in patients suffering from a sickle cell crisis while hospitals find ways to curb the opioid crisis overall. Opioid treatment for patients in acute vaso-occlusive crisis has significantly contributed to quality of life and life expectancy of patients with this diagnosis. Measures should continue to attempt to administer a multi-model approach to sickle cell patients to minimize the morphine milligram equivalents in these patients while also successfully addressing the patient's pain. IV lidocaine is a pain medication that has been evaluated in several painful experiences, such as in renal colic. A few case reports have shown IV lidocaine use in sickle cell can be a potential effective adjunct medication to opioids to treat pain and reduce further opioid requirements. Currently, no prospective controlled trial exists to evaluate the true benefit of IV lidocaine in this population.

NCT01296698,Study to Determine if a New Nicotine Replacement Therapy Can Safely Help Smokers to Quit Smoking,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01296698,,TERMINATED,"This study is to see if a new nicotine replacement therapy safely helps people to quit smoking if it is used the way it would be if it were sold at the pharmacy and used at home. Approximately 1500 subjects will be enrolled into the study. The study will require participants to use the treatment for 12 weeks and there will be a 14-week follow-up period. The study will be conducted in approximately 20 pharmacies across the United States.

At the first visit to the pharmacy, participants will be asked some questions to see if they are eligible to participate. Participants will be asked to sign a consent form if they agree to participate. Participants will answer some more questions, and blow into a machine to measure their carbon monoxide (CO) levels to make sure they qualify for the trial. Participants will be asked to go to a nearby dentist who will look at their mouths. Participants will go back to the pharmacy and if they qualify, they will be given a supply of their assigned treatment. They will have an equal chance of receiving a treatment that has a drug in it or one that has no drug in it. They will be given a diary to keep track of how much of the treatment they use.

Subjects will go to the pharmacy four more times to hand in their diaries and blow into a machine that will measure their CO levels. At the last visit, subjects will have their mouths examined by a dentist again to have their mouth checked.

Subjects will receive four telephone calls during the study where they will be asked some questions.

After the 12 week treatment period, subjects will receive two to three more telephone calls, where they will be asked to answer some questions.

This study will evaluate the efficacy of a spatial repellent in reducing mosquito biting on human beings and measure the impact any reduced biting will have on malaria transmission. The investigators will recruit and follow-up 5,984 children between 6 months and \<10 years of age in Busia County to determine how many times they will be infected with malaria in villages where the investigators will have distributed spatial repellents and compare the rate of infection to villages where the investigators will not have distributed the repellent devices. Additionally, the investigators will measure whether the distribution of spatial repellents in one village will drive mosquitoes to their neighboring houses thereby increasing malaria transmission in those areas. The children participating in the study will be divided into 3 groups (cohorts). The first group will be followed up during the first 4 months before any intervention is distributed and the purpose here will be to determine that the villages are comparable. After this, the investigators will recruit the next group of participants and follow them up for 1 year and repeat this again for another year. During the follow-up, the children will be asked to come to the health facility where they will be tested for malaria using RDT or blood slide for microscopy.

NCT04058977,Redefining Survivorship: POWER to Maximize Physical Function for Survivors of Critical Illness,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04058977,POWER,WITHDRAWN,"Patients surviving critical illness experience significant skeletal muscle dysfunction and weakness. Muscle atrophy suffered during critical illness has a long-term impact on the functionality and mobility of these individuals. As a result, individuals surviving critical illness have a significant reduction in quality of life, even up to 5 years post discharge. Research including large randomized controls demonstrates that rehabilitation focused on active mobilization may positively influence patient outcomes. Thus, early mobilization is an important intervention that has many purported benefits. Current rehabilitation practice in the intensive care unit (ICU) and recommendations from clinical practice guidelines such as the Society of Critical Care Medicine, PADIS Guidelines support these interventions to reduce the detrimental effects of immobilization during critical illness. Early mobilization is routinely thought of as standard of care for patients admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. However, a significant number of recent randomized controlled trials implementing early rehabilitation and mobilization interventions fail to demonstrate immediate or long-term benefits.10,11,18,19 Interesting, active mobilization and rehabilitation analyzed in systematic review had no impact on mortality and ""no consistent effects of function, quality of life and ICU or hospital length of stay.""18 There are a few potential explanations for interventions not leading to reduction in impairment or functional benefit.

Scientific Premise: From our preliminary data (Figure 1) and my clinical experience, a significant cause of the physical impairments in these patients is reductions in muscular power. Muscular power is a critical determinant of functional mobility.20 Preliminary data demonstrate that lower extremity muscle power is significantly reduced in this population and furthermore, these deficits are strongly correlated to physical function. Muscle power training is a potential therapeutic intervention that could lead to more robust improvements in physical function. This concept has been explored extensively in community-dwelling older adults. A recent systematic review of controlled trials demonstrates that power training is superior to traditional resistance training at improving functional performance when comparing the two training modalities.21 Furthermore, power training is feasible for older adults and clinical populations of Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, and frailty.22-27 Thus the feasibility and pragmatic nature of power training is not a concern. Of interest, a randomized controlled trial was completed in institutionalized frail nonagenarians (\>85 years or older).27 In this study, no patients drop-out of study due to power training and significant benefits in function were achieved.27 Therefore, the investigators propose a interventional trial to study the effect of a standardized muscle power training program for patients admitted to the ICU for critical illness.",NO,Critical Illness|Muscle Atrophy or Weakness,OTHER: Power training,"Short Performance Physical Battery, This outcome measure is scored from 0-12 with lower scores representing disability and higher scores representing better physical function.

NCT01481766,Iron Treatment for Young Children With Non-anemic Iron Deficiency,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01481766,OptEC,COMPLETED,"The pre-school years are critical years for children to acquire early learning skills such as language, fine motor and social skills; this is termed early child development. Primary care doctors (family doctors and pediatricians) are in a unique position to identify children with health or developmental problems. Screening is the process of testing healthy people for the earliest signs of health problems, followed by treatment, with the expectation that screening will improve the health of those screened. The focus of this research is screening young children for the earliest signs of iron deficiency (low blood iron levels) followed by treatment with oral iron.

Previous research has shown that children with later stages of iron deficiency have serious delays in their development. Some research has shown that these delays may persist into young adulthood often with a significant reduction in intelligence. Early stages of iron deficiency may be difficult for parents or doctors to detect, and a blood test is usually needed. However, Canadian guidelines do not recommend screening all children for iron deficiency, because there is not enough good quality research to prove that screening is effective.

In this study, the investigators will ask parents to allow their child between the ages of 1 to 3 years to have a blood test for iron levels. If the blood level is low, the child will be randomly assigned to receive either oral iron liquid for 4 months plus diet counseling, or a placebo liquid plus diet counseling. A psychologist will measure each child's early learning ability before and after the treatment. If this approach to screening children's blood iron levels followed by treatment improves children's development, parents and doctors may consider that routine blood screening tests are justified. Overall, this research is an important step to improving the ways in which primary care doctors can ensure that children have the best start to life-long health and achievement.",NO,Non-anemic Iron Deficiency,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Ferrous Sulfate|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo|BEHAVIORAL: Dietary counseling,"Mullen Scales of Early Learning, The Mullen Scales of Early Learning assess the cognitive functioning of young children from birth to 68 months.

A limited but growing body of evidence suggests that screening for and addressing these needs - also referred as social determinants of health -- in clinic settings helps to connect patients to resources to address unmet needs and has the potential to improve health outcomes. Veterans carry a high burden of unmet needs. At present, VA systematically screens for only two unmet needs; homelessness and food insecurity. The investigators propose to assess the efficacy of systematically screening Veterans for nine unmet needs (i.e., housing, food insecurity, utility insecurity, transportation, legal problems, employment, safety, stress, and social isolation), and compare the effect of referral mechanisms of varying intensity on Veterans' connection to resources, reduction of unmet needs, treatment adherence, reduced preventable hospitalizations, and clinical outcomes.",YES,Cardiovascular Disease|Hypertension|Diabetes Mellitus|Hyperlipidemia,BEHAVIORAL: Unmet Need Screening|BEHAVIORAL: Unmet Need Referral - Resource Sheet|BEHAVIORAL: Unmet Need Referral Assistance,"Number of Participants Who Connected With a New Resource, Defined as participant connecting to one or more resources since the index unmet need screen and assessed via a participant survey administered 8 weeks following the index unmet need screen.

The measure will be based on pharmacy dispensing data from CDW to specify the proportion of days covered (PDC) of each medication. To calculate this, the investigators will count the # of days dispensed in relation to the dispensing period.

NCT01123577,Evaluation of Integrating Self Blood Pressure Monitoring Into Urban Primary Care Practices,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01123577,ESBPM,COMPLETED,"Background:

Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in the United States and New York City (NYC). One in 4 NYC adults has hypertension, with higher prevalence in both Blacks and Latinos compared to Whites (Angell 2008). In NYC, only 65% of all adults with HTN and on treatment are controlled (Angell 2008).

Self-blood pressure monitoring (SBPM) is associated with reduced blood pressure in patients with hypertension (Cappuccio 2004). Studies suggest that SBPM may increase control either by inducing clinicians to titrate medication more actively, (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 2002) by engaging patients to participate in their own health care, (Taylor 2007) or a combination of the two.

However, minimal research has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of SBPM in different racial and/or ethnic groups or in low income populations or to discern effective patterns of SBPM use by patients. Best practices for integration of self monitoring into HTN into regular treatment have also yet to be established.

Objectives:

The goal of this study is to assess the impact of SBPM under conditions consistent with existing community health clinic resources and infrastructure in NYC's medically underserved neighborhoods using commonly available automated home BP monitors. By using a community clinic's electronic health record (EHR) and automated BP monitors with the capability to transmit readings to a research database, we can facilitate a more rigorous evaluation of a pilot SBPM intervention and assess patterns of home monitor use and clinical management and their association with outcomes.

The three specific aims of this intervention are to:

1. Assess whether use of SBPM reduces elevated BP and increases HTN control to similar levels in two historically understudied minority populations, Blacks and Latinos.
2. Confirm pilot findings by assessing the impact of SBPM on BP and HTN control compared to usual care using randomized controlled trial methodology.
3.

Adolescent Obesity Prevention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03103269,Challenge,COMPLETED,"The prevalence of overweight among adolescents (BMI-for-age %tile over the 95th percentile) has more than tripled over the past 3 decades in the US. Overweight and physical inactivity disproportionately affect low- income, female, African American adolescents.

A prior health-promotion/ obesity-prevention program for adolescents developed and tested by our group (Challenge!) showed that adolescents who received the intervention were less likely to become overweight or obese over 2 years when compared to the control group. This intervention was administered one-on-one to adolescents in their homes or community by a college-aged mentor.

Schools are an ideal setting for interventions because the effect can be far-reaching and sustainable. School-based obesity-prevention interventions have thus far shown modest results.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multilevel intervention that includes both the Challenge program administered in a small group format after school using mentors and teachers and a school-wide environmental change on adolescent females' body composition, diet, and physical activity. The intervention is targeted to 6th and 7th grade female students. The small group intervention is conducted over 12 weeks and includes goal setting focusing on healthy diet and physical activity, along with membership and weekly trips to the YMCA.

The HAC develops school-wide health promotion messages and activities. Parents of participating 6th and 7th grade girls provide information on family variables.

NCT00659230,Nepicastat for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in OIF/OEF Veterans,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00659230,Nepicastat,COMPLETED,"This study proposes a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the dopamine-ß-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor, nepicastat, for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in outpatients who have previously served in a combat zone during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF)or other Southwest conditions since 19800. A DBH inhibitor's mechanism of action is to decrease neuronal noradrenaline (NA) release by inhibiting DBH conversion of dopamine (DA) to NA. Animal models of PTSD and human studies have found a substantial increase in NA activity for these animal models and for PTSD in humans. Furthermore, recent clinical studies have improved PTSD hyper-arousal symptoms by reducing the NA over-activity using agents like NA post-synaptic antagonists. Key support for the proposed study is based on a similar improvement in PTSD symptoms after treatment with the DBH inhibitor, disulfiram.

In the experience of the clinical investigators, the most common chief complaint of the OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD is hyperarousal (DSM-IV criterion D symptom cluster). These symptoms significantly interfere with social, occupational, and interpersonal function. Standard treatments with antidepressants are not fully effective in treating the symptoms of PTSD in veterans; thus, new treatments are needed. An intervention, such as nepicastat, aimed at reducing hyperarousal, as well as other PTSD symptoms, would have significant impact of restoring overall function and quality of life in OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD. Since hyperarousal symptoms responded relatively quickly to medications of this type, our study in 120 outpatient veterans with PTSD will compare nepicastat 120 mg/day vs. placebo in a 6-week double-blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT). The veterans will be followed for an additional 8 weeks after the RCT, during which, those who have a priori defined positive clinical response to the study medication, nepicastat vs. placebo, will be continued on the study medication, in order to assess further improvement and safety. Those patients who do not have a positive clinical response during the 6 week RCT will be offered the addition of the standard first-line PTSD pharmacotherapy, paroxetine, during the 8 weeks extension phase. Thus, weeks 7-14 offer an opportunity to evaluate longer-term nepicastat efficacy and to compare the treatment response of nonresponders after augmentation with paroxetine.",YES,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,DRUG: Nepicastat|DRUG: Placebo,"Clinician Administered PTSD Scale Subscore D (Hyperarousal), The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale subscore D (CAPS-D) measures the hyperarousal cluster for PTSD symptoms (5 items).

NCT02620852,Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures of Risk (Wisdom Study),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02620852,WISDOM,RECRUITING,"Most physicians still use a one-size-fits-all approach to breast screening in which all women, regardless of their personal history, family history or genetics (except BRCA carriers) are recommended to have annual mammograms starting at age 40. Mammograms benefit women by detecting cancers early when they are easier to treat, but they are not perfect. Recent news stories have discussed some of the potential harms: large numbers of positive results that cause stressful recalls for additional mammograms and biopsies. With the current screening approach, half of the women who undergo annual screening for ten years will have at least one false positive biopsy. Potentially more important are cancer diagnoses for growths that might never come to clinical attention if left alone (called ""overdiagnosis""). This can lead to unnecessary treatment. Even more concerning is evidence that up to 20% of breast cancers detected today may fall into the category of ""overdiagnosis.""

This study compares annual screening with a risk-based breast cancer screening schedule, based upon each woman's personal risk of breast cancer. The investigators have designed the study to be inclusive of all, so that even women who might be nervous about being randomly assigned to receive a particular type of care (a procedure that is typical in clinical studies) will still be able to participate by choosing the type of care they receive.

For participants in the risk-based screening arm, each woman will receive a personal risk assessment that includes her family and medical history, breast density measurement and tests for genes (mutations and variations) linked to the development of breast cancer. Women who have the highest personal risk of developing breast cancer will receive more frequent screening, while women with a lower personal risk would receive less frequent screening. No woman will be screened less than is recommended by the USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines.

If this study is successful, women will gain a realistic understanding of their personal risk of breast cancer as well as strategies to reduce their risk, and fewer women will suffer from the anxiety of false positive mammograms and unnecessary biopsies.

CPIC was developed and is being run by community and academic partners in Los Angeles underserved communities of color. CPIC compares two ways of supporting diverse health and social programs in under-resourced communities to improve their services to depressed clients. One approach is time-limited expert technical assistance coupled with culturally-competent community outreach to individual programs, on how to use quality improvement toolkits for depression that have already been proven to be effective or helpful in primary care settings, but adapted for this study for use in diverse community-based programs in underserved communities. The other approach brings different types of agencies and members in a community together in a 4 to 6-month planning process, to fit the same depression quality improvement programs to the needs and strengths of the community and to develop a network of programs serving the community to support clients with depression together. The study is designed to determine the added value of community engagement and planning over and above what might be offered through a community-oriented, disease management company. Both intervention models are based on the same quality improvement toolkits that support team leadership, care management, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, medication management, and patient education and activation. Investigators hypothesized that the community engagement approach would increase agency and clinician participation in evidence-based trainings and improve client mental health-related quality of life. In addition, during the design phase, community participants prioritized adding as outcomes indicators of social determinants of mental health, including physical functioning, risk factors for homelessness and employment.

NCT06770998,A Study of a Novel EEG Neurofeedback System for PTSD Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06770998,,RECRUITING,"The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if training with the Prism system can reduce PTSD symptoms in US military Veterans and civilians with PTSD. Prism is a form of neurofeedback training that uses EEG signals to promote self-regulation of brain function. The main question this study aims to answer is:

Does Prism training lead to decreased PTSD symptoms in US Veterans and civilians when used in addition to usual PTSD treatment?

Researchers will compare Prism training to a sham training (a look-alike training that does not provide real feedback on brain activity) to see if Prism training decreases PTSD symptoms.

Participants will:

* Complete two one-hour in-person training sessions a week for about 8 weeks (15 sessions)
* Complete two booster training sessions one month and two months after finishing the main training course
* Participate in three detailed interviews: one before training, a second after nine weeks of training, and a third one month after the last booster training session (about 20 weeks after the initial visit)",NO,"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",DEVICE: EEG-neurofeedback training|DEVICE: Sham training,"Total CAPS-5-R score change from Baseline to Week 9, Participants will take the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 Revised (the CAPS-5-R) before beginning Prism training.

NCT04684043,Prognostic Implications of Physiologic Investigation After Revascularization With Stent,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04684043,POST-PCI FLOW,UNKNOWN,"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a standard treatment strategy for coronary artery disease (CAD). With the presence of myocardial ischemia, PCI reduces the risks of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and revascularization compared to medical therapy. However, the risk of future clinical events remains high, and about 10% of patients experienced further cardiovascular events after PCI. Several factors are associated with these poor outcomes. Well known patient-related risk factors are diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, left ventricular dysfunction, previous MI, and presentation with the acute coronary syndrome. Procedure-related factors, such as stent underexpension, malapposition, edge dissection, the number of the used stent, and total stent length, are also related to poor prognosis after PCI. Recent studies reported that fractional flow reserve (FFR) after coronary stenting, or post PCI FFR, was associated with future clinical outcomes after PCI, and low post PCI FFR value was associated with procedural factors. However, optimal cut-off values of post-PCI FFR ranged widely, from 0.86 to 0.96, and some study reported the limited prognostic value of post-PCI FFR. This might result from differences in study populations, the definition of outcomes, type of stent used, and distribution of included vessels among previous studies.
